Changelog QOL mod 1-6
First of all a big thank you for the helping hands of Oiz, Finneyyy, AlexKrisnov.
They have provided invaluable help to advance the progress of the mod and Oiz even made us our very own split-merge application for qsp-files

NEW means something has been added or significantly changed with regards to core gameplay

- NEW reminder function for phone notebook entries. The reminder will be triggered when a new day starts and only remind once for now
- NEW 'sleep' has been 'repaired' to have influence on the character again. When sleep is Zero the players mood will be affected
- NEW changed time for 'Search for a job online' in the computer menu to take 15 minutes instead of 1 hour (4 times better chance to find a job)
- NEW random street event when not wearing panties has been overhauled and fixed. It didnt give any xp for exhibitionism and would raise the players submissiveness. While exhibitionism is below 30 it will lower mood but raise willpower and adds exhibitionism experience. It will raise mood and willpower when exhibitionism is above 30 and still give a bit of experience.
- NEW a few more help texts beside those in the status window
- NEW weigth change warnings in the bath will now be very visual as pop-up messages so you know clothes might not fit
