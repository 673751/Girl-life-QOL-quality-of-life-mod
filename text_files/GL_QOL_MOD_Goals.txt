What are the goals for the project?

1. Make the game playable without the constant need to cheat
2. Make it easier to integrate new content like events/quests/places by simplifying the code
3. If time/interest etc allow - move to new player with cleaned code to provide better media access and functionality


What are the milestones?

1. Streamlining content into behaving less arbitrary
2. Provide the user with as much ingame info/hints as needed to normally progress with quests/events
3. automate code functionality as much as possible and unify those processes to behave identically
4. Repair and/or replace core functions that are obviously not working and document these functions publicly
